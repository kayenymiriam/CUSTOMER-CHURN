### INTRODUCTION
This is an Excel project on the analysis of data from a tour and travel company having predictors of churning.


### OBJECTIVES
1.What is the age distribution of customers?
2.How does the number of services opted for vary across different income classes?
3.Does income class influence  booking of a hotel?
4.How does the age distribution of customers who book hotels compare to those who do not?
5.What factors are the strongest predictors of churn?

### DATA SOURCING
This data was obtained from kaggle, an online website containing datasets. It contains 954 rows with 7 columns (Age, Frequent flyer, annual income class, services opted, booked hotel or not, target and account synced to social media). 


### ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION
1.	With a minimum age of 27years, a maximum age of 40 years and an average age of 32 years, majority of the clients were between the ages of 30 and 32 years.
The histogram is asymmetrical and unimodal.

2.On income class and number of services opted for:
 - Only over 50 clients in the high income class opted for 1 service while those who opted for more than one service were significantly less than 50.
 - Over 50 clients in the low income class opted for either one or two services while those who opted for more than two services were less than 50.
 - Over 50 clients in the middle income class opted for one, two, three or four serves while those that opted for more than four services were less than 50.
This could be due to the fact that majority of middle income and low income class individuals find it convenient and cost effective to use tour and travel company packages.

3.Majority of those in the middle income class book hotels, followed by those in the low income class and lastly, the high income class. This data was from a tour and travel company and didnâ€™t specify how much the travellers were paying per night or whether they all booked the same hotel. It is unclear whether there is any correlation between income class and booking a hotel in this data set due to this missing data.

4. The average age of clients who booked hotels was the same as that of all clients regardless of whether or not they had booked a hotel prior to traveling.
5. With a churn rate of 23.48%, some of the characteristics of majority who churned are;
-65% flew frequently
-56% had their accounts synced to social media
-46% were in the low income class, and 41% of the high income class
-79% did not book hotels prior to traveling
-Their average age was 32.11
-They opted for an average of 2 services.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
-	Those in the middle income class are less likely to churn
-	Most youth travel often
